# Development Environments

I like to develop for embedded platforms as a hobby. The problem is that I am a
bit fickle, and when I decide that I want to rush off to the next thing, I
don't want to worry about all of the debris from developing for the board to be
left on my filesystem. Here, I just toss all of the stuff in a container, and
develop for a while, until I get frustrated or buy a new toy. Then, cleanup is
as simple as getting rid of a container.

I tried to follow the directions [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp8266-rtos-sdk/en/latest/get-started/index.html).
